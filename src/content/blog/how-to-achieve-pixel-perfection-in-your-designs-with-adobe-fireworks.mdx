When it comes to user interface design, Adobe Fireworks is an excellent tool for laying out your ideas and also for creating cutting edge graphics for your App/Website. Like in any other graphic software, there are different ways to create one effect. However, the result doesn‘t always look the same for each method. In this article, I want to show you how to achieve real pixel perfection in your designs.

## Create smooth glow effects using feathered edge

When you have an object in your design that you want to emphasize for some reason, making it shine is a great way of grabbing the attention of your users, and also of keeping the interface eye-catchy. In Adobe Fireworks, there are three main ways how to create a glow/shadow, but the result is also different for each method.

### Fireworks Glow Effect

This is the standard glow effect provided by Fireworks. The effect can be added to any object via adding the Filter, “Glow“.

In this example I’ve used a glow distance of 0 pixels and an opacity of 50% while I’ve set the blur to 14px. This should generate a wide glow without any distance to the light source.
