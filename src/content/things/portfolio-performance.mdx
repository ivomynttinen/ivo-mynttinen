For tracking my investments in exchange-traded funds, Portfolio Performance is my go-to tool. It’s packed with detailed statistics, summaries, and reports, making financial planning more efficient. The standout feature, though, is its automatic import of PDF bank statements, which saves me a ton of time when bulk-entering trades—just a few seconds, and I’m done!

The app is open-source and stores all data locally, ensuring both transparency and control over my financial information.
