Eagle has completely transformed the way I collect and organize visual inspiration. This app lets me grab and store any type of visual content—whether it’s screenshots, videos, inspiration images, or even entire websites—directly to my local storage library. It’s like having my own offline Pinterest, but without the clutter, ads, or the risk of losing everything.

I made the switch to a local-first approach after getting burned too many times by online services shutting down and taking my collections with them (looking at you, Forrst). With Eagle, everything is stored safely offline forever, and the browser extensions make saving content fast and effortless.
