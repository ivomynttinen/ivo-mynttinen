When it comes to writing things down, Obsidian has been my go-to tool. It’s a powerful, local-first app that goes way beyond basic note-taking. Thanks to its robust community plugins, Obsidian can adapt to almost any note-taking workflow. Features like the Canvas and Graph view provide unique, alternative ways to visualize and navigate your notes, making it perfect for both structured documentation and creative brainstorming.

However, as much as I love Obsidian, the lack of a self-hostable sync server is a drawback for me. For now, it’s still my main note-taking app, but I’m considering replacing it with [SiYuan](https://github.com/siyuan-note/siyuan), which is sadly not as polished as Obsidian, but better aligns with my preference for self-hosted solutions.
