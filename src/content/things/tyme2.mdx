I’ve been using Tyme 2 for over a decade, and while it’s starting to show its age, it still serves me well. The app offers full iCloud sync and makes managing projects and tasks simple and straightforward. Unfortunately, it’s no longer being updated, and I know I’m just waiting for the day when a macOS update renders it unusable.

While there’s a Tyme 3 available, it’s a subscription-based app, which isn’t a fit for me. Until Tyme 2 stops working, it remains my reliable time-tracking tool. When the time comes, I’ll be on the hunt for a new solution.
