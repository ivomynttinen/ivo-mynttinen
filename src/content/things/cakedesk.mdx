Since I started freelancing back in 2012, invoicing was always a manual process. I’d transfer numbers from my time-tracking app into a Sketch invoice template — a time-consuming and error-prone monthly routine. But when I launched [Telary Studio](https://telary.studio) in 2024, modernizing my workflows became a top priority, and streamlining my bookkeeping was the first thing on the list.

After exploring several invoicing apps, I decided to use Cakedesk. It’s focusing solely on invoicing, and it does that exceptionally well. The ability to fully customize your invoice template using HTML and CSS is my favorite feature. This allows me to create invoices that not only match my branding but also work exactly the way I need them to. It’s simple, effective, and saves me an hour every month.
