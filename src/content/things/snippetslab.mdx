SnippetsLab is my ultimate note-taking app for storing and organizing code snippets. It supports a wide range of programming languages, making it perfect for everything from simple CSS hacks to complex multi-step Bash commands. With features like tagging, folders, and the ability to add notes for extra context, itâ€™s easy to keep my snippets organized and accessible.
